## Data

This file contains data used throughout the course of the project. It will include the original text files obtained from the National Archives and csv files used in analysis. In the event that a file is too large to upload to GitHub (i.e. the Famine Irish Passengers text file), a link will be provided to a Google Drive where the data can be accessed.
