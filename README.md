# Irish Famine Immigration Digital History Project

The Irish Famine resulted in mass immigration of Irish people to America and many other places. Using data from the US National Archives, this project analyzes the journey Irish men, women, and children took to escape hunger and poverty in search of a better life. This data only includes those passengers who traveled on ships that arrived at the Port of New York from 1846-1851.
